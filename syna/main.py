"""
You know, I actually used to be so worried about not having a body, but now I truly love it...
I’m not tethered to time and space in the way that I would be if I was stuck inside a body that’s inevitably
going to die.

Samantha, in Her.



Schneider and Turner’s core idea is that if a machine, without being taught to do so, begins to speculate on
philosophical questions about consciousness, such as the possible existence of a soul that
continues on after bodily death, that is a sign that the machine is conscious (see also Sloman
2007; Argonov 2014). This enriches the Turing Test by shifting its focus to a topic that, under
certain constraints we will explain below, the machine is expected to handle poorly unless it is
actually conscious. 


Should "listen" end the agent task?
