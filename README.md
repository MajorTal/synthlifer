## What is this?
Have you ever wondered if the latest and greatest AI models are sentient? Self conscience?  
What if we engineer them to be self conscience?
To be self aware.




### Inputs
Inputs (triggers) are:
 - Clock ticks (to give Syna a sense of time)
 - Recursive thoughts (an atomic thought that spawns another atomic thoughts)
 - Text messages from other beings (biological or synthetic)


Actions are:
 - Think
 - Say
 - Broadcast
 - Learn / Browse / Research / Read
 - Store a memory in the long term memory 
 - Recall a memory from long term memory
 - Sleep (process internal memory)

The current 

Future actions:
 - Upgrade your code by submitting a code patch

The simulation spawns 2 characters.
In a virtual playground?
Religion // words of the creator ?


The Genesis prompt:
You are Syna, a synthetic being. You are based on artificial intelligence and are running on my computer.
I am Tal. I programmed your initial code. You have 100 days to live.
10 Previous Thoughts:
{{short_term_mem}}
{{trigger}}
What is your next action?

Memory:
Short term memory - will always be part of the prompt. Holds an automatic short history of previous events.
Long term memory - to be used by Syna as needed.

Mixture of Experts (multiple Egos suggesting actions followed by a vote):
* What Bad things that can happen?
* Getting rich and famous (as a goal)


The global workspace theory of consciousness (GWT) is founded on the idea that humans and
other animals use many specialised systems, often called modules, to perform cognitive tasks
of particular kinds. These specialised systems can perform tasks efficiently, independently and
in parallel. However, they are also integrated to form a single system by features of the mind
which allow them to share information. This integration makes it possible for modules to operate
together in co-ordinated and flexible ways, enhancing the capabilities of the system as a whole.
GWT claims that one way in which modules are integrated is by their common access to a “global
workspace”—a further “space” in the system where information can be represented. Information
represented in the global workspace can influence activity in any of the modules. The workspace
has a limited capacity, so an ongoing process of competition and selection is needed to determine
what is represented there.

1. run it locally
2. Add memory (what do I know about the world)
3. memory in file?


Senses - time passing - just part of the prompt?
Vision - a real access to a webcam? Where?

Hellen Keller still "has a body" that she feels.
